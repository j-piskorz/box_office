# box_office
ML model to predict the box office of a movie based on its features.

This project was inspired by the following Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction
In order to predict the box office of the movies, I used tools such as SHapley Additive exPlanations, Boruta Feature Selection, PCA and more feature engineering tools.
